This folder contains SASS files from the Whitehall project used to style
inside gov. In the future these files will most likely be part of the
frontend toolkit (allowing easy updates), but until then I've included
them as static resources in this git repo.

The _organisations.scss file has been modified to remove Inside Gov
dependencies on right-to-left and ig-core fonts.
